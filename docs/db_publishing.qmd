title: Publishing Transcripts
---

## Overview

In this article we'll cover recommended ways to publish transcript databases for use by others. Whenever publishing transcripts you should be mindful to do everything you can to prevent them from entering the training data of models (as this may "leak" benchmark datasets). The main mitigations available for this are:

1. Making access to the transcripts authenticated using non HTTP protocols (e.g. S3 or Hugging Face); and

2. Encrypting the transcript database files so that if they are republished in an unauthenticated HTTP context that crawlers won't be able to read them.

We'll cover both of these scenarios in detail below.

## Hugging Face

Publishing transcript databases as a [Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets) is useful when you want to share with a broader audience. Benefits of using Hugging Face include:

1. You can make access private to only your account or organization.

2. You can create a [Gated Dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-gated) that requires users to provide contact information and optionally abide by a usage agreement and share other information to obtain access.

See the Hugging Face documentation on [uploading datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-adding) for details on how to create datasets. For transcript databases, you can just upload the parquet file(s) into the root of the dataset repository.

To access a dataset on Hugging Face:

1.  Install the `huggingface_hub` Python package:
 
    ```bash
    pip install huggingface_hub
    ```

2.  Configure credentials either by setting the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable or via login:

    ```bash
    hf auth login
    ```

3.  Refer to your dataset in a scout scan using the `hf://` protocol. For example:

    ```bash
    scout scan scanner.py -T hf://datasets/account-name/dataset-name
    ```

See [Encryption](#encryption) below for details on adding encyption to database files as an additional measure of protection from crawlers.

## S3

Publishing transcripst databases to AWS [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) enables you to configure authenticated access using S3 credentials. S3 buckets support a wide variety of options for authorization (see the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-management.html) for further details). 

After you have uploaded the parquet file(s) for your transcript database to an S3 bucket, you can refer to it in a scout scan using the `s3://` protocol. For example:

```bash
scout scan scanner.py -T s3://my-transcript-databases/database-name
```

See [Encryption](#encryption) below for details on adding encyption to database files as an additional measure of protection from crawlers.
