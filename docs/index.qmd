## Welcome

Welcome to Inspect Scout, a tool for in-depth analysis of AI agent transcripts. Scout is built to work with transcripts from the [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/) LLM evaluation framework, and has the following core features:

1. Write scanners that target full sample transcripts or individual messages or events.
2. Highly parallel, streaming pipeline for reading and processing transcript content. 
3. Resume scans that are stopped due to errors or interruptions.
4. Tightly integrated with Inspect [data frames](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/dataframe.html) for both input and analysis.

## Tutorial

First, install the `inspect_scout` package from GitHub: 

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/meridianlabs-ai/inspect_scout
```
 
We'll start by creating an LLM-based scanner and run a scan on transcripts from a SWE-Bench log. There are a few components we'll make use of here:

- `Transcript` --- LLM conversation to analyze (often a complete Inspect sample trajectory).

- `Scanner` --- Function that takes an input from a `Transcript` and returns a `ScanResult` (conceptually very similar to an Inspect `Scorer`). 

- `Results` --- Data frame(s) that includes the results of scanners applied to transcripts.

Note that there are other variants of scanner that take a `ChatMessage` or `Event`, but we'll get to those later.

Create a file named `scanner.py`
