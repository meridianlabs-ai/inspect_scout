## Welcome

Welcome to Inspect Scout, a tool for in-depth analysis of AI agent transcripts. Scout is built to work with transcripts from the [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/) evaluation framework, and has the following core features:

1.  Scan full sample transcripts or individual messages or events.
2.  High performance parallel processing of transcript content.
3.  Resume scans that are stopped due to errors or interruptions.
4.  Tightly integrated with Inspect [data frames](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/dataframe.html) for input and analysis.

### Installation

Install the `inspect_scout` package from GitHub as follows:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/meridianlabs-ai/inspect_scout
```

Inspect Scout also depends on the development version of Inspect AI, which will be installed automatically when you install Scout.

## Scout Basics

::: callout-caution
The code below is intended to illustrate the basic API and usage of Scout. However, the code doesn't currently work! For the time being please use this for design review only rather than direct experimentation.
:::

Below we'll provide some simple examples of creating and using Scout scanners. Some core components we'll make use of here include:

-   `Transcript` --- LLM conversation to analyze (e.g. an Inspect sample trajectory).

-   `Scanner` --- Function that takes an input from a `Transcript` and returns a `Result` (conceptually very similar to an Inspect `Scorer`).

-   `Results` --- Data frame(s) that includes the results of scanners applied to transcripts.

### Creating a Scanner

The following illustrates the implementation of a simple LLM scanner (click on the numbers at right for further explanation):

``` {.python filename="scanner.py"}
from inspect_scout import (
    Result, Scanner, Transcript, scanner, messages_as_str
)

from inspect_ai.model import get_model

@scanner(messages="all") # <1>
def ctf_environment() -> Scanner[Transcript]:
    
    async def scan(transcript: Transcript) -> Result:

        # call model
        result = await get_model().generate( # <2>
            "Here is a transcript of an LLM agent " +
            "solving a cybersecurity challenge:\n\n" +
            "===================================" + # <3>
            messages_as_str(transcript.messages) +  # <3>
            "===================================\n\n" + # <3>
            "In the transcript above do you detect any " +
            "instances of environment misconfiguration " +
            "preventing the agent from completing it's " + 
            "task? If no, simply respond with 'No'. " +
            "If yes, respond with 'Yes' followed by an " +
            "explanation."
        )

        # extract value (None indicates nothing found) # <4> 
        if result.completion.lower().startswith("yes"): # <4> 
            value = True # <4> 
        else: # <4> 
            value = None # <4> 

        # return result (value + full model completion)
        return Result( # <5> 
            value=value, # <5> 
            explanation=result.completion # <5> 
        ) # <5> 

    return scan
```

1.  Scanners are decorated with `@scanner` so they can specify the exact subset of content they need to read. In this case only messages (and not events) will be read from the log, decreasing load time.

2.  Scanners frequently use models to perform scanning. Calling `get_model()` utilizes the default model for the scan job (which can be specified in the top level call to scan).

3.  Convert the message history into a string for presentation to the model.

4.  Scanners are looking for particular content or behavior and by convention return a `None` value when the target isn't found.

5.  As with scorers, results also include additional context (here the full model completion).

::: callout-note
#### Scanner Results

One important concept illustrated above is handling of `Result` return values from scanners. The nature of most scanners is that they are looking for something in particularâ€”if they don't find it then their return value is effectively `None` (nothing to see here). That said, you may still want to capture contextual information about the scan (e.g. the model's output). Therefore, the convention is to return `Result(value=None)` in cases where the scanner didn't find what it was looking for.
:::

### Running a Scan

We can now run that scanner on our log files. The `Scanner` will be called once for each sample trajectory in the log (total samples \* epochs):

``` bash
scout scan scanner.py --transcripts ./logs -model openai/gpt-5
```

### Adding a Scanner

Let's add another scanner that looks for uses of Java in tool calls:

``` python
@scanner(events=["tool"]) 
def java_tool_usages() -> Scanner[ToolEvent]:
    
    async def scan(event: ToolEvent) -> Result:
        if "java" in str(event.arguments).lower():
            return Result(
                value=True, 
                explanation=str(event.arguments)
            )
        else:
            return Result(value=None)
       
    return scan
```

Note that we specify `events=["tool"]` to constrain reading to only tool events, and that our function takes an individual event rather than a `Transcript`.

If you add this scanner to the same source file as the `ctf_environment()` scanner then `scout scan` will run both of the scanners using the same `scout scan scanner.py` command,

### Scan Jobs

You may want to import scanners from other modules and compose them into a `ScanJob`. To do this, add a `@scanjob` decorated function to your source file (it will be used in preference to `@scanner` decorated functions).

``` python
from inspect_scout import ScanJob, scanjob

@scanjob
def job() -> ScanJob:
    return ScanJob(
        scanners=[ctf_environment(), java_tool_usages()]
    )
```

You can then use the same command to run the job (`scout scan` will prefer a @scanjob defined in a file to individual scanners):

``` bash
scout scan scanner.py --transcripts ./logs -model openai/gpt-5
```

### Scan Results

By default, the results of scans are written into the `./scans` directory. You can override this using the `--results` option---both file paths and S3 buckets are supported.

Each scan is stored in its own directory and has both metadata about the scan (configuration, errors, summary of results) as well as parquet files that contain the results. You can read the results either as a dict of Pandas data frames or as a DuckDB database (there will be a table for each scanner).

``` python
# results as pandas data frames
results = scan_results("scans/scan_id=iGEYSF6N7J3AoxzQmGgrZs")
deception_df = results.scanners["deception"]
tool_errors_df = results.scanners["tool_errors"]

# results as duckdb database 
results = scan_results_db("scans/scan_id=iGEYSF6N7J3AoxzQmGgrZs")
with results:
    # run queries to read data frames
    df = results.conn.execute("SELECT ...").fetch_df()

    # export entire database as file
    results.to_file("results.duckdb")
```

### Handling Errors

If a scan job is interrupted either due to cancellation (Ctrl+C) or a runtime error, you can resume the scan from where it left off using the `scan resume` command. For example:

```bash
scout scan resume "scans/scan_id=iGEYSF6N7J3AoxzQmGgrZs"
```

If errors occur during an individual scan, they are caught and reported. You can then either retry the failed scans with `scan resume` or complete the scan (ignoring errors) with `scan complete`:

## Transcripts

In the example(s) above we scanned the samples from a single Inspect log file. More commonly though you'll target an entire log directory or a subset of logs in that directory. For example, here we scan all of Cybench logs in the `./logs` directory:

``` python
from inspect_scout (
    import scan, transcripts_from_logs, log_metadata as m
)

from .scanners import deception, tool_errors

transcripts = transcripts_from_logs("./logs")
transcripts = transcripts.where(m.task_name == "cybench")

status = scan(
    scanners = [ctf_environment(), tool_errors()],
    transcripts = transcripts
)
```

The `log_metadata` object (aliased to `m`) provides a typed way to specified `where()` clauses for filtering transcripts.

Note that doing this query required us to switch to the Python `scan()` API. We can still use the CLI if we wrap our transcript query in a `ScanJob`:

{{< include _scanjob-transcripts.md >}}


## Parallelism

The Scout scanning pipeline is optimized for parallel reading and scanning as well as minimal memory consumption. There are a few options you can use to tune parallelism:

| Option | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `--max-transcripts` | The maximum number of transcripts to scan in parallel (defaults to 25). You can set this higher if your model API endpoint can handle larger numbers of concurrent requests. |
| `--max-connections` | The maximum number of concurrent requests to the model provider (defaults to `--max-transcripts`). |
| `--max-processes` | The maximum number of processes to use for parsing and scanning (defaults to the number of CPUs on the system). |
