# Inspect Scout

> Inspect Scout is a tool for in-depth analysis of AI agent transcripts. Scout is built to work with transcripts from the [Inspect AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/) evaluation framework, and has the following core features: (1) Scan full sample transcripts or individual messages or events; (2) High performance parallel processing of transcript content; (3) Resume scans that are stopped due to errors or interruptions; (4) Tightly integrated with Inspect [data frames](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/dataframe.html) for input and analysis.
