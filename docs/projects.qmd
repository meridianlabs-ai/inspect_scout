## Overview

In some cases you'll prefer to define your transcript source and filters, scanning model, and other configuration once for a project rather than each time you run `scout scan`. You can do this with a `scout.yaml` project file. 

For example, if we have this project file in our working directory:

```{.yaml filename="scout.yaml"}
transcripts: s3://weave-rollouts/
filter: 
  - task_set='cybench'
model: openai/gpt-5
```

Then we can run a scan with simply:

``` bash
scout scan scanner.py 
```

Note that the `filter` field contains one or more SQL WHERE clauses that address fields in the [transcript database](db_schema.qmd).

You can also define the location of scanning results and other configuration in project files. For example:

```{.yaml filename="scout.yaml"}
transcripts: s3://weave-rollouts/
filter: 
  - task_set='cybench'
scans: ./cybench-scans

max_processes: 4

model: openai/gpt-5
generate_config:
   temperature: 0.0
   reasoning_effort: minimal
   max_connections: 50

tags: [ctf, cybench]
```

Note that `scout.yaml` project files are intended to be checked in to version control so do not contain secrets. See the section below on using [environment files](#environment-files) for details on handling secrets.

## Project Settings

Project files support all of the same options available to [scan jobs](#scan-jobs). The table below describes the available configuration fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | str | Project name (defaults to directory name). |
| `transcripts` | str | Transcript source: local path, S3 URL, or list of sources. |
| `filter` | str \| list | SQL WHERE clauses that filter based on fields in the transcript database. |
| `scans` | str | Location for scan results (defaults to `./scans`). |
| `model` | str | Model for scanning (e.g., `openai/gpt-5`). |
| `model_base_url` | str | Base URL for model API. |
| `model_args` | dict \| str | Model creation args as a dictionary or path to JSON/YAML file. |
| `generate_config` | dict | Generation config (e.g., `temperature`) |
| `model_roles` | dict | Named model roles for use with `get_model()`. |
| `max_transcripts` | int | Maximum concurrent transcripts to process (defaults to 25). |
| `max_processes` | int | Maximum concurrent processes for multiprocessing (defaults to 4). |
| `limit` | int | Limit the number of transcripts processed. |
| `shuffle` | bool \| int | Shuffle transcript order. Pass an `int` to set a random seed. |
| `tags` | list | Tags to associate with scans (e.g., `[ctf, cybench]`). |
| `metadata` | dict | Arbitrary metadata to associate with scans. |
| `log_level` | str | Console log level (defaults to `warning`). |
| `scanners` | list \| dict | Scanner specifications to include in all scans. |
| `worklist` | list | Transcript IDs to process for each scanner. |
| `validation` | dict | Validation sets to apply for specific scanners. |

### Local Config

In some cases you might want to provide local overrides to a shared project configuration file. You can do this by adding a `scout.local.yaml` file alongside your `scout.yaml` file. For example, here we override the main project file with a different model, max connections, and log level:

```{.yaml filename="scout.local.yaml"}
model: openai/gpt-5-mini
generate_config:
   max_connections: 100
log_level: info
```

Be sure to add `scout.local.yaml` to your `.gitignore` so it isn't checked in to version control.

## Environment (.env) {#environment-files}

While `scout.yaml` project files are intended to be checked into version control, you'll often have secrets and credentials that should not be committed. Use a `.env` file for these values.

Common secrets to store in `.env`:

- API keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.
- Access tokens: `HF_TOKEN` for Hugging Face datasets and models.
- Cloud credentials: AWS credentials for S3 access

When you run `scout scan` or other Scout commands, the `.env` file in your working directory (or any parent directory) is automatically loaded. For example:

```{.bash filename=".env"}
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

Be sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidentally committing secrets.

See the Inspect AI documentation on [environment files](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/options.html#env-files) for additional details on `.env` file handling

## Scan Jobs

Projects share all configuration fields with [scan jobs](reference/scanning.qmd#scanjob). When you run a scan, the project configuration is automatically merged with the scan job (whether defined in code via `@scanjob` or in a YAML/JSON config file).

The merge follows these rules:

- For simple fields like `scans`, `model`, `max_transcripts`, etc., the project value is used only when the scan job doesn't specify a value.

- The input transcripts (`transcripts`, `filter`) are treated as an atomic unit. A scan job can fully override project transcripts but not e.g. add clauses to the `filter`.

- The model configuration (`model`, `model_base_url`, `model_args`, `generate_config`) are also treated as an atomic unit. If the scan job specifies a model, all model-related configuration comes from the scan job. Otherwise, all model configuration comes from the project.

- For collection fields like `tags`, `metadata`, `scanners`, `worklist`, and `validation`, values from both the project and scan job are combined. If there are key conflicts, the scan job value takes precedence.

For example, given this project:

```{.yaml filename="scout.yaml"}
transcripts: s3://weave-rollouts/cybench
model: openai/gpt-5
tags: [production]
```

And this scan job:

```{.yaml filename="scan.yaml"}
scanners:
  - file: scanner.py
tags: [safety-audit]
```

The effective configuration will use `transcripts` and `model` from the project, `scanners` from the scan job, and the merged tags `[production, safety-audit]`.

## Default Project

When you run `scout scan` or other Scout commands, the system automatically searches for a `scout.yaml` project file wihtin the current working directory.

If no project file is found, Scout uses the following defaults:

- `name`: Project directory name
- `transcripts`: `./transcripts` (if that directory exists) or `./logs` (if that directory exists)
- `scans`: `./scans`
