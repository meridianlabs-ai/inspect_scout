title: Results

## Overview

The results of scans are stored in directory on the local filesystem (by default `./scans`) or in a remote S3 bucket. When a scan job is completed its directory is printed, and you can also use the `scan_list()` function or `scout scan list` command to enumerate scan jobs.

Scan results include the following:

-   Scan configuration (e.g. options passed to `scan()` or to `scout scan`).

-   Transcripts scanned and scanners executed and errors which occurred during the last scan.

-   A set of [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) files with scan results (one for each scanner). Functions are available to interface with these files as Pandas data frames.

## Workflow

### Scout CLI

The `scout scan` command will print its status at the end of its run. If all of the scanners completed without errors you'll see a message indicating the scan is complete along with a pointer to the scan directory where results are stored:

If you are running in VS Code, you can click the scan directory to view the results in Scout View. If you are using another editor, execute `scout view` from the terminal to launch the viewer:

```bash
scout view
```

To get programmatic access to the results, pass the scan directory to the `scan_results_df()` function:

``` python
from inspect_scout import scan_results_df

results = scan_results_df("scans/scan_id=3ibJe9cg7eM5zo3h5Hpbr8")
deception_df = results.scanners["deception"]
tool_errors_df = results.scanners["tool_errors"]
```

### Python API

The `scan()` function returns a `Status` object which indicates whether the scan completed successfully (in which case the scanner results are available for analysis). You'll therefore want to check the `.completed` field before proceeding to read the results. For example:

``` python
from inspect_scout import (
    scan, scan_results_df, transcripts_from
)

from .scanners import ctf_environment, java_tool_calls

status = scan(
    transcripts=transcripts_from("./logs"),
    scanners=[ctf_environment(), java_tool_calls()]
)

if status.complete:
    results = scan_results_df(status.location)
    deception_df = results.scanners["deception"]
    tool_errors_df = results.scanners["tool_errors"]
```

## Results Data

The `Results` object returned from `scan_results_df()` includes both metadata about the scan as well as the scanner data frames:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| `complete` | bool | Is the job complete? (all transcripts scanned) |
| `spec` | ScanSpec | Scan specification (transcripts, scanners, options, etc.) |
| `location` | str | Location of scan directory |
| `summary` | Summary | Summary of scan (results, metrics, errors, tokens, etc.) |
| `errors` | list\[Error\] | Errors during last scan attempt. |
| `scanners` | dict\[str, pd.DataFrame\] | Results data for each scanner (see [Data Frames](#data-frames) for details) |

: {tbl-colwidths=\[20,20,60\]}
