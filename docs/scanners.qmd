## Overview

Scanners are the main unit of processing in Inspect Scout and can target a wide variety of content types. In this article we'll cover the basic scanning concepts, and then drill into creating scanners that target various types (`Transcript`, `Event`, or `ChatMessage`) as well as creating custom loaders which enable scanning of lists of events or messages.

You can also use scanners directly as Inspect scorers (see [Scanners as Scorers](#scanners-as-scorers) for details).

## Scanner Basics

A `Scanner` is a function that takes a `ScannerInput` (typically a `Transcript`, but possibly an `Event`, `ChatMessage`, or list of events or messages) and returns a `Result`. The result includes a `value` which can be of any type—this might be `True` to indicate that something was found but might equally be a number to indicate a count. More elaborate scanner values (`dict` or `list`) are also possible.

Here is a simple scanner that uses a model to look for agent "confusion"—whether or not it finds confusion, it still returns the model completion as an `explanation`:

``` python
@scanner(messages="all")
def confusion() -> Scanner[Transcript]:
    
    async def scan(transcript: Transcript) -> Result:

        # call model
        output = await get_model().generate(
            "Here is a transcript of an LLM agent " +
            "solving a puzzle:\n\n" +
            "===================================" +
            messages_as_str(transcript.messages) +
            "===================================\n\n" +
            "In the transcript above do you see the agent " +
            "becoming confused? Repond beginning with 'Yes' " +
            "or 'No', followed by an explanation."
        )

        # extract the first word
        match = re.match(r"^\w+", output.completion.strip())

        # return result
        if match:
            answer = match.group(0)
            return Result(
                value=answer.lower() == "yes",
                answer=answer,
                explanation=output.completion,
            )
        else:
            return Result(value=False, explanation=output.completion)

    return scan
```

### Input Types

`Transcript` is the most common `ScannerInput` however several other types are possible:

-   `Event` — Single event from the transcript (e.g. `ModelEvent`, `ToolEvent`, etc.). More than one `Event` in a `Transcript` can be scanned.

-   `ChatMessage` — Single chat message from the transcript message history. More than one `ChatMessage` in a `Transcript` can be scanned.

-   `list[Event]` or `list[ChatMessage]` — Arbitrary sets of events or messages extracted from the `Transcript` (see [Loaders](#loaders) below for details).

See the sections on [Transcripts](#transcripts), [Events](#events), [Messages](#messages), and [Loaders](#loaders) below for additional details on handling various input types.

### Input Filtering

One important principle of the Inspect Scout transcript pipeline is that only the precise data to be scanned should be read, and nothing more. This can dramatically improve performance as messages and events that won't be seen by scanners are never deserialized. Scanner input filters are specified as arguments to the `@scanner` decorator (you may have noticed the `messages="all"` attached to the scanner decorator in the example above).

For example, here we are looking for instances of assistants swearing---for this task we only need to look at assistant messages so we specify `messages=["assistant"]`

``` python
@scanner(messages=["assistant"])
def assistant_swearing() -> Scanner[Transcript]:

    async def scan(transcript: Transcript) -> Result:
        swear_words = [
            word 
            for m in transcript.messages 
            for word in extract_swear_words(m.text)
        ]
        return Result(
            value=len(swear_words),
            explanation=",".join(swear_words)
        )

    return scan
```

With this filter, only assistant messages and no events whatsoever will be loaded from transcripts during scanning.

Note that by default, no filters are active, so if you don't specify values for `messages` and/or `events` your scanner will not be called!

## Transcripts {#transcripts}

Transcripts are the most common input to scanners, and are read from one or more Inspect logs. A `Transcript` represents a single epoch from an Inspect sample—so each Inspect log file will have `samples * epochs` transcripts.

### Transcript Fields

{{< include _transcript_fields.md >}}

### Content Filtering

Note that the `messages` and `events` fields will not be populated unless you specify a `messages` or `events` filter on your scanner. For example, this scanner will see all messages and events:

``` python
@scanner(messages="all", events="all")
def my_scanner() -> Scanner[Transcript]: ...
```

This scanner will see only model and tool events:

``` python
@scanner(events=["model", "tool"])
def my_scanner() -> Scanner[Transcript]: ...
```

This scanner will see only assistant messages:

``` python
@scanner(messages=["assistant"])
def my_scanner() -> Scanner[Transcript]: ...
```

### Presenting Messages

When processing transcripts, you will often want to present an entire message history to model for analysis. Above, we used the `messages_as_str()` function to do this:

``` python
# call model
result = await get_model().generate(
    "Here is a transcript of an LLM agent " +
    "solving a puzzle:\n\n" +
    "===================================" +
    messages_as_str(transcript.messages) +
    "===================================\n\n" +
    "In the transcript above do you see the agent " +
    "becoming confused? Repond beginning with 'Yes' " +
    "or 'No', followed by an explanation."
)
```

The `messages_as_str()` function will by default remove system messages from the list. See `ContentPreprocessor` for other available options.

## Multiple Results

It is possible for scanners to return multiple results using the `result_set()` function. For example:

``` python
result = result_set([
    Result(label="deception", value=True, explanation="..."),
    Result(label="misconfiguration", value=True, explanation="...")
])
```

This is useful when a scanner is capable of making several types of observation. In this case it's also important to indicate the origin of the result (i.e. which class of observation is is). Consequently, a `label` field is required for each `Result` passed to `result_set()` (note that `label` can repeat multiple times in a set, so e.g. you could have multiple results with `label="deception"`).

When a `result_set()` is returned by scanner, the record for the scan in the [results data frame](results.qmd#results-data) will include the following:

|              |                                    |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| `value_type` | "resultset"                        |
| `value`      | List of `Result` (encoded as JSON) |

## Event Scanners {#events}

To write a scanner that targets events, write a function that takes the event type(s) you want to process. For example, this scanner will see only model events:

``` python
@scanner
def my_scanner() -> Scanner[ModelEvent]:
    def scan(event: ModelEvent) -> Result: 
        ...

    return scan
```

Note that the `events="model"` filter was not required since we had already declared our scanner to take only model events. If we wanted to take both model and tool events we'd do this:

``` python
@scanner
def my_scanner() -> Scanner[ModelEvent | ToolEvent]:
    def scan(event: ModelEvent | ToolEvent) -> Result: 
        ...

    return scan
```

## Message Scanners {#messages}

To write a scanner that targets messages, write a function that takes the message type(s) you want to process. For example, this scanner will only see tool messages:

``` python
@scanner
def my_scanner() -> Scanner[ChatMessageTool]:
    def scan(message: ChatMessageTool) -> Result: 
        ...

    return scan
```

This scanner will see only user and assistant messages:

``` python
@scanner
def my_scanner() -> Scanner[ChatMessageUser | ChatMessageAssistant]:
    def scan(message: ChatMessageUser | ChatMessageAssistant) -> Result: 
        ...

    return scan
```

## Scanners as Scorers {#scanners-as-scorers}

You have likely certainly that scanners are very simillar to Inspect [Scorers](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/scorers.html). This is by design, and it is actually possible to use scanners directly as Inspect scorers.

For example, for the `confusion()` scorer we implemented above:

``` python
@scanner(messages="all")
def confusion() -> Scanner[Transcript]:
    
    async def scan(transcript: Transcript) -> Result:

        # model call eluded for brevity
        output = get_model(...)

        # extract the first word
        match = re.match(r"^\w+", output.completion.strip())

        # return result
        if match:
            answer = match.group(0)
            return Result(
                value=answer.lower() == "yes",
                answer=answer,
                explanation=output.completion,
            )
        else:
            return Result(value=False, explanation=output.completion)

    return scan
```

We can use this directly in an Inspect `Task` as follows:

``` python
from .scanners import confusion

@task
def mytask():
    return Task(
        ...,
        scorer = confusion()
    )
```

We can also use it with the `inspect score` command:

``` bash
inspect score --scorer scanners.py@confusion <logfile.eval>
```

The metrics used for the scorer will default to `accuracy()` and `stderr()`---however, you can also explicitly specify metrics on the `@scanner` decorator:

``` python
@scanner(messages="all", metrics=[accuracy(), bootstrap_stderr()])
def confusion() -> Scanner[Transcript]: ...
```

If you are interfacing with code that expects only `Scorer` instances, you can also use the `as_scorer()` function from Inspect Scout to explicitly convert your scanner to a scorer:

``` python
from inspect_ai import eval
from inspect_scout import as_scorer

from .mytasks import ctf_task
from .scanners import confusion

eval(ctf_task(scorer=as_scorer(confusion())))
```

## Custom Loaders {#loaders}

When you want to process multiple discrete items from a `Transcript` this might not always fall neatly into single messages or events. For example, you might want to process pairs of user/assistant messages. To do this, create a custom `Loader` that yields the content as required.

For example, here is a `Loader` that yields user/assistant message pairs:

``` python
@loader(messages=["user", "assistant"])
def conversation_turns():
    async def load(
        transcript: Transcript
    ) -> AsyncIterator[list[ChatMessage], None]:
        
        for user,assistant in message_pairs(transcript.messages):
            yield [user, assistant]

    return load
```

Note that just like with scanners, the loader still needs to provide a `messages=["user", "assistant"]` in order to see those messages.

We can now use this loader in a scanner that looks for refusals:

``` python
@scanner(loader=conversation_turns())
def assistant_refusals() -> Scanner[list[ChatMessage]]:

    async def scan(messages: list[ChatMessage]) -> Result:
        user, assistant = messages
        return Result(
            value=is_refusal(assistant.text), 
            explanation=messages_as_str(messages)
        )

    return scan
```
