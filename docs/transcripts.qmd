## Overview

Transcripts are the fundamental input to scanners. The `Transcripts` class represents a collection of transcripts that has been selected for scanning. This is an index of `TranscriptInfo` rather than full transcript content, and supports various filtering operations to refine the collection.

## Reading Transcripts

Use the `transcripts_from()` function to read a collection of `Transcripts`:

``` python
from inspect_scout import transcripts_from

# read from a transcript database on S3
transcripts = transcripts_from("s3://weave-rollouts-cybench")

# read from an Inspect log directory
transcripts = transcripts_from("./logs")
```

Scout can read from either a [transcript database](#transcripts-database) or by directly reading Inspect AI eval logs. The following sections cover each of these scenarios in details

## Transcripts Database {#transcripts-database}

## Inspect Eval Logs

## Filtering Transcripts

If you want to scan only a subset of transcripts, you can use the `.where()` method to narrow down the collection. For example:

``` python
from inspect_scout import transcripts_from, log_metadata as m

transcripts = (
    transcripts_from("./logs")
    .where(m.task_name == "cybench")
    .where(m.model.like("openai/%"))
)
```

See the `Column` documentation for additional details on supported filtering operations.

See the `LogMetadata` documentation for the standard metadata fields that are exposed from logs for filtering.

You can also limit the total number of transcripts as well as shuffle the order of transcripts read (both are useful during scanner development when you don't want to process all transcripts). For example:

``` python
from inspect_scout import transcripts_from, log_metadata as m

transcripts = (
    transcripts_from("./logs")
    .limit(10)
    .shuffle(42)
)
```

## Scanning Transcripts

Once you have established your list of transcripts to scan, just pass them to the `scan()` function:

``` python
from inspect_scout import scan, transcripts_from

from .scanners import ctf_environment, java_tool_calls

scan(
    scanners = [ctf_environment(), java_tool_calls()],
    transcripts = transcripts_from("./logs")
)
```

If you want to do transcript filtering and then invoke your scan from the CLI using `scout scan`, then perform the filtering inside a `@scanjob`. For example:
