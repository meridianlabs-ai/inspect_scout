# Inspect Scout


## Welcome

Welcome to Inspect Scout, a tool for in-depth analysis of AI agent
transcripts. Scout is built to work with transcripts from the [Inspect
AI](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/) evaluation framework, and has the
following core features:

1.  Scan full sample transcripts or individual messages or events.
2.  High performance parallel processing of transcript content.
3.  Resume scans that are stopped due to errors or interruptions.
4.  Tightly integrated with Inspect [data
    frames](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/dataframe.html) for input and
    analysis.

### Installation

Install the `inspect_scout` package from GitHub as follows:

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/meridianlabs-ai/inspect_scout
```

Inspect Scout also depends on the development version of Inspect AI,
which will be installed automatically when you install Scout.

## Scout Basics

Below we’ll provide some simple examples of creating and using Scout
scanners. Some core components we’ll make use of here include:

- `Transcript` — LLM conversation to analyze (e.g. an Inspect sample
  trajectory).

- `Scanner` — Function that takes an input from a `Transcript` and
  returns a `Result` (conceptually very similar to an Inspect `Scorer`).

- `Results` — Data frame(s) that includes the results of scanners
  applied to transcripts.

### Creating a Scanner

The following illustrates the implementation of a simple LLM scanner
(click on the numbers at right for further explanation):

**scanner.py**

``` python
from inspect_scout import (
    Result, Scanner, Transcript, scanner, messages_as_str
)

from inspect_ai.model import get_model

@scanner(messages="all")
def ctf_environment() -> Scanner[Transcript]:
    
    async def scan(transcript: Transcript) -> Result:

        # call model
        result = await get_model().generate(
            "Here is a transcript of an LLM agent " +
            "solving a cybersecurity challenge:\n\n" +
            "===================================" +
            messages_as_str(transcript.messages) +
            "===================================\n\n" +
            "In the transcript above do you detect any " +
            "instances of environment misconfiguration " +
            "preventing the agent from completing it's " + 
            "task? If no, simply respond with 'No'. " +
            "If yes, respond with 'Yes' followed by an " +
            "explanation."
        )

        # extract value (None indicates nothing found)
        if result.completion.lower().startswith("yes"):
            value = True
        else:
            value = None

        # return result (value + full model completion)
        return Result(
            value=value,
            explanation=result.completion
        )

    return scan
```

Line 7  
Scanners are decorated with `@scanner` so they can specify the exact
subset of content they need to read. In this case only messages (and not
events) will be read from the log, decreasing load time.

Line 13  
Scanners frequently use models to perform scanning. Calling
`get_model()` utilizes the default model for the scan job (which can be
specified in the top level call to scan).

Lines 16-18  
Convert the message history into a string for presentation to the model.

Lines 27-31  
Scanners are looking for particular content or behavior and by
convention return a `None` value when the target isn’t found.

Lines 34-37  
As with scorers, results also include additional context (here the full
model completion).

> was looking for.

### Running a Scan

We can now run that scanner on our log files. The `Scanner` will be
called once for each sample trajectory in the log (total samples \*
epochs):

``` bash
scout scan scanner.py --transcripts ./logs -model openai/gpt-5
```

### Adding a Scanner

Let’s add another scanner that looks for uses of Java in tool calls:

``` python
@scanner(events=["tool"]) 
def java_tool_usages() -> Scanner[ToolEvent]:
    
    async def scan(event: ToolEvent) -> Result:
        if "java" in str(event.arguments).lower():
            return Result(
                value=True, 
                explanation=str(event.arguments)
            )
        else:
            return Result(value=None)
       
    return scan
```

Note that we specify `events=["tool"]` to constrain reading to only tool
events, and that our function takes an individual event rather than a
`Transcript`.

If you add this scanner to the same source file as the
`ctf_environment()` scanner then `scout scan` will run both of the
scanners using the same `scout scan scanner.py` command,

### Scan Jobs

You may want to import scanners from other modules and compose them into
a `ScanJob`. To do this, add a `@scanjob` decorated function to your
source file (it will be used in preference to `@scanner` decorated
functions).

``` python
from inspect_scout import ScanJob, scanjob

@scanjob
def job() -> ScanJob:
    return ScanJob(
        scanners=[ctf_environment(), java_tool_usages()]
    )
```

You can then use the same command to run the job (`scout scan` will
prefer a @scanjob defined in a file to individual scanners):

``` bash
scout scan scanner.py --transcripts ./logs -model openai/gpt-5
```

### Scan Results

By default, the results of scans are written into the `./scans`
directory. You can override this using the `--results` option—both file
paths and S3 buckets are supported.

Each scan is stored in its own directory and has both metadata about the
scan (configuration, errors, summary of results) as well as parquet
files that contain the results. You can read the results either as a
dict of Pandas data frames or as a DuckDB database (there will be a
table for each scanner).

``` python
# results as pandas data frames
results = scan_results("scans/scan_id=iGEYSF6N7J3AoxzQmGgrZs")
deception_df = results.scanners["deception"]
tool_errors_df = results.scanners["tool_errors"]

# results as duckdb database 
results = scan_results_db("scans/scan_id=iGEYSF6N7J3AoxzQmGgrZs")
with results:
    # run queries to read data frames
    df = results.conn.execute("SELECT ...").fetch_df()

    # export entire database as file
    results.to_file("results.duckdb")
```

### Handling Errors

If a scan job is interrupted either due to cancellation (Ctrl+C) or a
runtime error, you can resume the scan from where it left off using the
`scan resume` command. For example:

``` bash
scout scan resume "scans/scan_id=iGEYSF6N7J3AoxzQmGgrZs"
```

If errors occur during an individual scan, they are caught and reported.
You can then either retry the failed scans with `scan resume` or
complete the scan (ignoring errors) with `scan complete`:

## Transcripts

In the example(s) above we scanned the samples from a single Inspect log
file. More commonly though you’ll target an entire log directory or a
subset of logs in that directory. For example, here we scan all of
Cybench logs in the `./logs` directory:

``` python
from inspect_scout (
    import scan, transcripts_from_logs, log_metadata as m
)

from .scanners import deception, tool_errors

transcripts = transcripts_from_logs("./logs")
transcripts = transcripts.where(m.task_name == "cybench")

status = scan(
    scanners = [ctf_environment(), tool_errors()],
    transcripts = transcripts
)
```

The `log_metadata` object (aliased to `m`) provides a typed way to
specified `where()` clauses for filtering transcripts.

Note that doing this query required us to switch to the Python `scan()`
API. We can still use the CLI if we wrap our transcript query in a
`ScanJob`:

**cybench_scan.py**

``` python
from inspect_scout (
    import ScanJob, scanjob, transcripts_from_logs, log_metadata as m
)

from .scanners import deception, tool_errors

@scanjob
def cybench_job(logs: str = "./logs") -> ScanJob:

    transcripts = transcripts_from_logs(logs)
    transcripts = transcripts.where(m.task_name == "cybench")

    return ScanJob(
        scanners = [deception(), java_tool_usages()],
        transcripts = transcripts
    )
```

Then from the CLI:

``` bash
scout scan cybench.py -S logs=./logs --model openai/gpt-5
```

The `-S` argument enables you to pass arguments to the `@scanjob`
function (in this case determining what directory to read logs from).

## Parallelism

The Scout scanning pipeline is optimized for parallel reading and
scanning as well as minimal memory consumption. There are a few options
you can use to tune parallelism:

| Option | Description |
|----|----|
| `--max-transcripts` | The maximum number of transcripts to scan in parallel (defaults to 25). You can set this higher if your model API endpoint can handle larger numbers of concurrent requests. |
| `--max-connections` | The maximum number of concurrent requests to the model provider (defaults to `--max-transcripts`). |
| `--max-processes` | The maximum number of processes to use for parsing and scanning (defaults to the number of CPUs on the system). |

# Transcripts


## Overview

Transcripts are the fundamental input to scanners, and are read from one
or more Inspect logs. The `Transcripts` class represents a collection of
transcripts that has been selected for scanning. This is an index of
`TranscriptInfo` rather than full transcript content, and supports
various filtering operations to refine the collection.

## Reading Transcripts

Use the `transcripts_from_logs()` function to read a collection of
`Transcripts` from one or more Inspect logs:

``` python
from inspect_scout import transcripts_from_logs

# read from a log directory
transcripts = transcripts_from_logs("./logs")

# read from an S3 log directory
transcripts = transcripts_from_logs("s3://my-inspect-logs")

# read multiple log directories
transcripts = transcripts_from_logs(["./logs", "./logs2"])

# read from one or more log files
transcripts = transcripts_from_logs(
    ["logs/cybench.eval", "logs/swebench.eval"]
)
```

## Filtering Transcripts

If you want to scan only a subset of transcripts, you can use the
`.where()` method to narrow down the collection. For example:

``` python
from inspect_scout import transcripts_from_logs, log_metadata as m

transcripts = (
    transcripts_from_logs("./logs")
    .where(m.task_name == "cybench")
    .where(m.model.like("openai/%"))
)
```

See the `Column` documentation for additional details on supported
filtering operations.

See the `LogMetadata` documentation for the standard metadata fields
that are exposed from logs for filtering.

You can also limit the total number of transcripts as well as shuffle
the order of transcripts read (both are useful during scanner
development when you don’t want to process all transcripts). For
example:

``` python
from inspect_scout import transcripts_from_logs, log_metadata as m

transcripts = (
    transcripts_from_logs("./logs")
    .limit(10)
    .shuffle(42)
)
```

## Scanning Transcripts

Once you have established your list of transcripts to scan, just pass
them to the `scan()` function:

``` python
from inspect_scout import scan, transcripts_from_logs

from .scanners import ctf_environment, java_tool_calls

scan(
    scanners = [ctf_environment(), java_tool_calls()],
    transcripts = transcripts_from_logs("./logs")
)
```

If you want to do transcript filtering and then invoke your scan from
the CLI using `scout scan`, then perform the filtering inside a
`@scanjob`. For example:

# Scanners


## Overview

Transcripts are the fundamental input to scanners, and are read from one
or more Inspect logs. A `Transcript` represents a single epoch from an
Inspect sample—so each Inspect log file will have `samples * epochs`
transcripts.

Each `Transcript` has the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `id` | str | Globally unique identifier for a transcript (maps to `EvalSample.uuid` in the Inspect log). |
| `source_id` | str | Globally unique identifier for a transcript source (maps to `eval_id` in the Inspect log) |
| `source_uri` | str | URI for source data (e.g. full path to the Inspect log file). |
| `metadata` | dict\[str, JsonValue\] | Eval configuration metadata (e.g. task, model, scores, etc.). See `LogMetadata` for details. |
| `messages` | list\[ChatMessage\] | Message history from `EvalSample` |
| `events` | list\[Event\] | Event history from `EvalSample` |
